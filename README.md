##Intemediate
  - Study [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org), read documentation and summarize the capabilities of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org)

    - Clearly describe the problem that the dataset represents
    - Summarize the data using descriptive statistics
    - Describe the structures you observe in the data and hypothesize about the relationships in the data.
    - Spot test a handful of popular machine learning algorithms on the dataset
    - Tune well-performing algorithms and discover the algorithm and algorithm configuration that performs well on the problem
